# LabTasks5
This program represents my proposed solution to the extra task from Lab 2. Unfortunately, the instructions provided were somewhat vague, so this implementation reflects my best interpretation of the requirements.

In this solution, we work with an array of structs to manage and manipulate the relevant data. The program is designed to demonstrate the use of dynamic memory allocation, struct manipulation, and efficient input/output operations.

If there are any ambiguities or improvements you'd like to discuss, feel free to reach out!
